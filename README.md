# juggernaut-ai-1
Simple chess playing ai using negamax algorithm without alpha-beta pruning

## Usage
Clone this project and run:
npm install

In the engine.js file, adjust your depth, to evaluate the best possible move. Till depth 3, the engine will not take much time. However going >3 will make the bot consume a lot of time.

## About (v1)
This is the first and the simplest version of the ai, very easy to beat, since it uses minimalistic to no evaluation.
